## Block of words explaining what this is

*Note*: This block of words is written like the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) funny
drawing "[Up Goer 5](https://xkcd.com/1133/)", using the [Simple
Writer](http://xkcd.com/simplewriter/)

This is a place to put words that build into things that run on a computer. The
words are written in the computer language named after what happens when a kind
of metal and some parts of air stay together over time. Actually, it was named
after a kind of life form that is not a animal, or green thing with leaves.
[It's kind of its own
thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/27jvdt/internet_archaeology_the_definitive_endall_source/).

Why "Number Directions" in that computer language I just said above? When
working with numbers you want to go fast. Really, really fast. That computer
language I was talking about above is suppose to be really fast. But also, it's
suppose to be safe when using different kinds of classes, and safe when the
computer language does a lot of work at the same time.

Also, I wanted to learn how to write in that computer language that I was
talking about at the beginning, and there is no better way to learn than by
doing.
